# About Technically Write Ltd.

We are a Northern Ireland–registered documentation and UX writing consultancy, incorporated on 27th August 2024. We help teams explain complex products delivering clear, concise technical documentation that improves usability, supports self-service, and helps customers adopt products faster. Based in the picturesque Annalong area of County Down, we work remotely with global organisations that need high-quality content across the full documentation lifecycle—from getting the foundations right (structure, standards, tooling and workflows) to long-term delivery and continuous improvement. Up to the time of writing this content, we’re the only dedicated technical writing services provider in Northern Ireland, offering a specialist alternative to generalist recruitment agencies.

Colin Hillis, Ph.D., FISTC is the founder and director of Technically Write Ltd. He is a Belfast-based technical writing manager and consultant with extensive experience helping teams explain complex products clearly, and is a Fellow of the Institute of Scientific and Technical Communicators (FISTC).

  <div className="twBioIntro">
    Colin is the founder and director of Technically Write Ltd. and works as a technical writing manager and consultant. He has a track record of establishing teams and dependable processes improving documentation quality at scale, and identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for automation across documentation workflows.

    Colin’s background spans a wide range of industries and product types, including application security, cyber security, banking, financial services digitisation, blockchain, data management, data protection, aviation/aerospace, and mechanical/electrical engineering. His roles have ranged from Technical Writer through to Senior Technical Writing Manager, including leading teams of up to eight writers in software environments and previously leading a large global team of 22 writers on aerospace programmes. 

    Across contracts and permanent roles, Colin has delivered end-to-end documentation suites.  This includes building full doc sets from scratch, performing rewrites of large internal and external documentation estates, and implementing documentation operations (“DocOps”) capabilities such as pipelines, tooling, plugins, scripts, and CSS. His toolset includes AsciiDoc, Markdown, OpenAPI/Swagger, Antora, Hugo, Docusaurus, MkDocs, GitBook, FrameMaker, and MadCap Flare, alongside GitHub, Jira, and Confluence, plus numerous other tools.
