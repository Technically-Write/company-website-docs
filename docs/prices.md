# Pricing

Every product, team, and documentation estate is different. For that reason, we quote based on scope, timelines, and the outcomes you need. We keep things simple and transparent, and we’re happy to work in the way that best suits your organisation: keen hourly rates for clearly defined tasks, fixed pricing per project, or retainer-style support for ongoing delivery.

## Flexible engagement models

* **Hourly Support** – ideal for short, contained tasks, audits, rewrites, quick wins, or perhaps smaller 'grey' projects where it is difficult to predict the effort required.

* **Project-Based Pricing** – a clear scope and deliverables, with a defined start and finish.

* **Bespoke / Blended Delivery** – combine specialist skills to match the work at each stage (strategy, AI, style, tooling, UX writing, developer docs, governance).

## The right expertise at the right time

Instead of hiring a single writer with one set of strengths, we can blend the skills of multiple writers into one solution and flex as your needs change. For example, we might establish documentation pipelines and team processes upfront, then transitioning to long-term delivery with an embedded writer, perhaps with some light steering from a technical writing manager. This approach helps you get senior-level capability when it matters most, without carrying long-term overhead.

## Planning upcoming Work?

Many organisations are increasingly using contract and resourcing models to reduce risk while still accessing experienced delivery. If you need capable hands quickly, or want to scope work before committing, let’s talk.

with a short description of what you’re building, what your documentation need is (internal guides, external guides, API documentation, release notes, etc.) your timeline, and any existing or desired tooling. Then we’ll come back promptly with the most suitable approach and prices.


## How much will it cost?
When engaging with us, it is worthwhile noting that there are many variables that contribute to our quotations:

* Is your product complex or relatively simple?
* Are your subject matter experts available to answer questions promptly?
* Are there existing up-to-date demos of your product’s features?
* How difficult is it to obtain screenshots for user interface documentation?
* Are dependencies like code examples and commands quickly accessible?
* Can we efficiently get access and permissions to any necessary repositories, systems, and tools? 
* Is your product stable or is it in a state of ongoing change?
* Do you have existing content or does everything need to be created from scratch?
* Do you have any customer research available?

Once we have an idea on the above variables, we can work out a competitive quotation for the work that you require.
