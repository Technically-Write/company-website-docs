# Pricing

Every product, team, and documentation estate is different. For that reason, we quote based on scope, timelines, and the outcomes you need. We keep things simple and transparent, and we’re happy to work in the way that best suits your organisation: keen hourly rates for clearly defined tasks, fixed pricing per project, or retainer-style support for ongoing delivery.

## Flexible Engagement Models

* **Hourly Support** – ideal for short, contained tasks, audits, rewrites, quick wins, or perhaps smaller 'grey' projects where it is difficult to predict the effort required.

* **Project-Based Pricing** – a clear scope and deliverables, with a defined start and finish.

* **Bespoke / Blended Delivery** – combine specialist skills to match the work at each stage (strategy, AI, style, tooling, UX writing, developer docs, governance).

## The Right Expertise at the Right Time

Instead of hiring a single writer with one set of strengths, we can blend the skills of multiple writers into one solution and flex as your needs change. For example, we might establish documentation pipelines and team processes upfront, then transitioning to long-term delivery with an embedded writer, perhaps with some light steering from a technical writing manager. This approach helps you get senior-level capability when it matters most, without carrying long-term overhead.

## Planning Upcoming Work?

Many organisations are increasingly using contract and resourcing models to reduce risk while still accessing experienced delivery. If you need capable hands quickly, or want to scope work before committing, let’s talk.

with a short description of what you’re building, what your documentation need is (internal guides, external guides, API documentation, release notes, etc.) your timeline, and any existing or desired tooling. Then we’ll come back promptly with the most suitable approach and prices.
